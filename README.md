# 🌍 Climate Analytics: Data Science Meets Environmental Change

This project is a multi-part R-based data science exploration focused on climate and environmental datasets. It applies **unsupervised learning**, **classification models**, **statistical regression**, and **visualization techniques** to analyze real-world data including weather patterns and global temperature trends.

## 🧪 Project Highlights

- 🌡️ **K-Means Clustering** on temperature and wind data from Miami Intl. Airport (2001–2020)
- 🔍 **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with decision boundary visualization
- 🌿 **Random Forest** & **Neural Networks** on the Iris dataset for multi-class classification
- 📈 **12th-Order Polynomial Regression** on NOAA global temperature anomaly data (1880–2018)
- 📊 **Confusion Matrices**, **Accuracy**, **Precision/Recall/F1 scores**, and **Variable Importance Plots**
